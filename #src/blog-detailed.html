          <p>an exhibition presenting the work of american artist adam pendleton and ghanaian-british artist and
            architect sir david adjaye has opened at pace gallery’s hong kong location. the exhibition features a new
            body of paintings by pendleton entitled ‘untitled (WE ARE NOT)’, presented in visual and spatial dialogue
            with a set of sculptural works by adjaye. viewed in concert, the works articulate a shared visual lexicon
            that explores questions of language, identity, and monumentality.

          <p>with the exhibition on view until june 30, 2021, designboom speaks with both pendleton and adjaye, as well
            as oliver shultz, curatorial director at pace gallery, to learn more about the presentation.</p>

          <p>the two artists first met in 2016 while pendleton was installing a solo exhibition at the museum of
            contemporary art denver, a building designed by adjaye. in the years that followed, their continued dialogue
            revealed a mutual interest in the politics of space and representation, as well as the relationship between
            art and architecture. ‘I’m drawn to david’s work as a visual idea,’ pendleton tells designboom. ‘his work
            relates sculptural experimentation to the pragmatic realities architecture so often has to address.’ david
            adjaye, who was recently awarded the 2021 royal gold medal for architecture, adds: ‘I think what’s beautiful
            about the commonality in our work is the question of form and how it supports space, perception, and, in a
            sense, a dialogue between the two’.</p>

          <p>originating from pendleton’s seminal ‘black dada’ text of 2008, the phrase ‘WE ARE NOT’ is broken down and
            merged to form all-over compositions. pendleton’s reiteration and reconfiguration of his own past language
            extends the dynamics of his ongoing ‘black dada’ project — a conceptual framework through which the artist
            explores ideas about the <a href="#">link example</a> the evocation of the past, with an emphasis on the relationship
            between blackness and the avant-garde. presented on the walls of pace’s hong kong gallery, the ‘untitled (WE
            ARE NOT)’ paintings similarly address questions of historical and collective definition, alluding obliquely
            to the rhetoric of contemporary identity politics.</p>
